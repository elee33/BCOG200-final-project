Our wordle game will run in terminal. To begin, we will print "Let's BCOG wordle!" and asks for a first guess of a five-letter word. Terminal will print "Guess 1:" and the user will be asked to type their first guess. 
If the first guess is wrong, "Incorrect" will be printed on the screen. The user will also recieve the letters in their first guess that are correctly places, misplaced, or wrong.
The user will then be prompted to make their second guess. This process will continue until the user has guessed the five-letter bcog word correctly. 
When the user guesses correclty, "Correct!" will be printed on the screen.
