1. For our project, we want to create a standard 5-letter wordle game with different categorical options that apply to our bcog200 course! The user will be able to select a category that the word will be from and receive 5 chances to guess the wordle correctly. After each guess, the user will receive an output of which letters they correctly guessed and if their position in the word is correct. 

2. 3 Functions:
  a. Choose Category Function - The user will be able to select from various psychology or neuroscience categories that their word will be from.
  b. Choose Word Function - Randomly generate a word from the provided vocabulary list within the category that the user has chosen.   This word will be used for the rest of the game.
  b. Is guess valid Function - This function will check if the input guess provided by the user is correct. There will be sub-functions within this function that will determine if the letters guessed are in the word and if the letters are in the correct place.

4. Group project
  a. The functions will be split up evenly, but we will collaborate to debug code. Each person will be responsible for 3-4 Functions of their choosing. 
  b. We will meet biweekly and discuss during class time to delegate work/responsibilities. Once a week, we will meet over the weekend to have time accounted for to work together on our project.
